This is a blog post project built in Django with its front end utilizing Jinja. There are mainly two types of users (admin and regulars).
An admin can do the CRUD on posts and add comments where as a regular user can only view posts and add comments.

You can find the project live at: https://blogpostdaphne-blogify-asgi-application.onrender.com/

This project uses web sockets along with AJAX to create, update and delete posts. Also the comments use websockets as well in order to be udpated dynamically.
